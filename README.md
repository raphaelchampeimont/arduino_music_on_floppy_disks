# arduino_music_on_floppy_disks
Playing music stored on floppy disks with two Arduinos

![General overview](/images/overview.jpg?raw=true)

Required hardware:
* 2 x Arduino Uno R3 (probably works with earlier versions too but untested)
* 1 x regular 3.5" 1.44MB floppy drive
* 1 x regular 1.44 MB floppy disk
* 13 x 1 kohm resitors (or 3 x 1khom resistors and 5 x 2 kohm resistors)
* 1 x 100 ÂµF (ore more) capacitor
* optional: 1 x operational amplifier circuit (only needed to drive a "raw" speaker, you don't need it to use headphones or "computer" speakers)
* optional: LEDs and their adapted resistors if you want the LEDs (just for debug/fun but the circuit works without LEDs of course)
